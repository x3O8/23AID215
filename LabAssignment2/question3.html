    <h2>Kuhli Loaches</h2>
    <p> The <span class = 'highlight'>kuhli loach</span> is an eel-shaped fish with slightly compressed sides (Anguilliform body structure), four pairs of barbels around the mouth, and very small fins. The dorsal fin starts behind the middle of the body, and the anal fin well behind this. The eyes are covered with transparent skin. The body has 10 to 15 dark brown to black vertical bars, and the gaps between them are salmon pink to yellow with a light underside. The stripes can be different on every individual but are mainly thick and solid stripes that can sometimes be split to reveal orange along the dorsal side. When the fish is not actively breeding, distinctions between males and females are not readily apparent. Males have a more muscular dorsal cross-section. Additionally, their pectoral fins tend to be larger and more paddle-shaped, often containing pigment. When breeding, the females often become larger than the male and their greenish ovaries can be seen through the skin before spawning. Spawning is not easy, but when it occurs a few hundred greenish eggs are laid among the roots of floating plants. Kuhli loaches reach maturity at 2.75 inches (7 cm) and have a maximum length of 4 inches (10 cm). This fish can live for up to about 14 years. They also have a spine below each eye that can be deployed as a defense mechanism that can harm any potential predators.</p>
